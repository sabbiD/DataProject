## Problem Statement

It has been over a decade that we first heard about the decline of bees. Colony collapse disorder (CCD) (in Dutch: bijenverdwijnziekte)
seems to be the reason but what are the causes for this disorder? And what is the effect of this decline in bees?
What is the current situation in the Netherlands?

## Solution

Through visualizing all the different aspects around the Colony Collapse Disorder and the bee decline
(in the Netherlands), it will become easier to comprehend the situation and to see if regulation is needed.  

  #### Target Audience
  Beekeepers, farmers, gardeners, honey-lovers, environmentalists, bee-lovers, nature-lovers, and everyone else who is interested in       the wellbeing of the earth.

  ### Functionalities:

  - A slider for years that updates the map of the Netherlands of the type of land/soil use and the rose chart showing pesticide use 
    , for that chosen year (MVP). 
  - A rose chart displaying the use of pesticides for a chosen year (MVP). 
  - A line graph showing the development of winter bee deaths, pesticide use, temperature changes, and possibly decline of 
   soil/land that enables bee health (MVP). With a dropdown button to switch between different types of pesticides (MVP).
  - A map of the Netherlands that shows the way in which the land/soil is used for a chosen year (MVP).
